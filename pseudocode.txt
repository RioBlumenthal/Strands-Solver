Step one is to get the grid from Strands
So start a browser window, go to strands, click Ok 
Then click on the done button to skip the ad

First make a list of every word on the board 
expressed as either (a 48 bit numbers where a 1 means there
is a letter there in the word and 0 means there isn't) or (a
list of the indexes of the letters in the word within the board)

then determine either the number of 1s or the length of the list and make a list
of all the possible combinations of n words whose length adds up to 48

then go through that list and check if they have overlap or not (bitwise operation?)
